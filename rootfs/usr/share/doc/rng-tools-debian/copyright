Changes:
 The Debian version of rngd is extensively patched with added
 functionality and bugs courtesy of Henrique de Moraes Holschuh.
 All changes were supposed to be proposed to be merged upstream, but the
 deviation got too large to handle, so it hasn't happened.  See upstream
 changelog for a list of all changes.
