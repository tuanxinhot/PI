Licence:

The MirBSD Korn Shell is covered by the MirOS Licence, which
is OSI approved, as reproduced below.

Binaries of the MirBSD Korn Shell on systems whose libc does
not provide a strlcpy function will additionally contain an
implementation under the ISC Licence, which is OSI approved,
and also reproduced below.

The lksh binary includes the UCB printf.c (also OSI approved
and reproduced below).

mksh16.xpm is hand-drawn; mksh16lg.xpm and mksh32.xpm are exports
of https://www.mirbsd.org/pics/mksh.svg (the mksh logo).
